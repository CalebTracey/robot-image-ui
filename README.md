## Usage

This app was bootstrapped with [vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

To start the client locally, first run:

`yarn install`

and then:

`yarn run dev`

By default the service is set to use the [ai-interaction-api](https://github.com/CalebTracey/ai-interaction-api) develop URL. If youd like to clone the api and hit that, switch the Post call in the Service.tsx file to use the `LOCAL_URL` constant
